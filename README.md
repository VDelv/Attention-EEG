# EEG-Attention

Repo for the work on attention EEG and saliency map.

Different features are given:
* Frequential feature with PSD for 3 different bands ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\theta$).
* Temporal feaures with Hjorth parameters.
* Handcrafted features from deep AutoEncoder.

Different models are presented:
* CNN for image based temporal or frequential features.
* RNN for temporal or frequential features.
* Graph based model.
* Deep Autoencoder for feature extraction.
